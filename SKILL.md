# Sui Dev Skills

This is a collection of Sui development skills. Each sub-skill is self-contained and should be loaded based on the task at hand. When multiple apply (e.g. a frontend app that constructs transactions), load all relevant skills together.

## Sub-skills

### sui-move — Smart Contracts
**Path:** `sui-move/SKILL.md`
**Load when:** writing, reviewing, debugging, or deploying Sui Move code; configuring `Move.toml`; working with the Sui object model; writing Move tests.
**Covers:** Move 2024 edition syntax, package setup, object ownership patterns, capability pattern, events, PTB-callable entry functions, `sui move test`, `sui move build`, `sui client publish`.

### sui-ts-sdk — TypeScript SDK
**Path:** `sui-ts-sdk/SKILL.md`
**Load when:** writing TypeScript/JavaScript that interacts with the Sui blockchain — backend scripts, CLIs, serverless functions, or the transaction-building layer of a frontend.
**Covers:** `@mysten/sui` package, PTB construction (`Transaction`, `moveCall`, `splitCoins`, `coinWithBalance`), `SuiClient`/`SuiGrpcClient` setup, keypair signing, transaction execution, on-chain queries.

### sui-frontend — Frontend dApp Kit
**Path:** `sui-frontend/SKILL.md`
**Load when:** building browser-based Sui dApps — React apps with `@mysten/dapp-kit-react`, or Vue/vanilla JS/Svelte apps with `@mysten/dapp-kit-core`.
**Covers:** `DAppKitProvider` setup, wallet connection, React hooks (`useCurrentAccount`, `useSignAndExecuteTransaction`, `useSuiClientQuery`), Web Components, nanostores state for non-React frameworks.
**Note:** For PTB construction within a frontend, load **sui-ts-sdk** alongside this skill.
